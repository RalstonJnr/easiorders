# easiorders

Welcome my Flask Application, 

I built this application for a company called Easishoppe , the biggest Easigas distributor in the WesternCape. 

It is a small intuitive program , that allows all office staff to load and track orders, 

I built it using , python (flask module) , html , css and abit of javascript, the flask application also stores the information a database , i used sqlite for this functionality.
